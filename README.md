# Vigenere
Encipher and Decipher using Vigenere's method
## Technologies
This project is written in Java using Eclipse and the interface (GUI) is JavaFX using SceneBuilder. 
There is also a bit of JUnit to help debug some methods.
## Introduction
We created this program to make it easier to encipher and decipher the codes in Lauren Child's Ruby Redfort books.

We managed to work out the key by comparing the ciphertext on the cover with plaintext in the book, 
then discovered that the method she used is cnamed after a frenchman called Vigen√®re who reinvented it.
